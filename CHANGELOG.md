## [0.2.0] - 2020-07-20

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/jpylypiw/easywall/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0)

### Added

- GitHub sponsorship was activated for the project
- A large number of configuration entries have been added
- Blocked connections can be logged by iptables
- Connections from blacklisted senders can be logged
- Broadcast, multicast and anycast packets can be blocked
- SSH brute force prevention was added. Attention! The feature is in alpha state and untested
- ICMP flood prevention has been implemented. The feature is also in alpha state
- Drop Invalid Packages was implemented. This is also an Alpa version
- Port Scan Prevention has been implemented. The feature is currently unstable in my tests
- IPv6 Router Advertisement connections can be allowed or prohibited
- IPv6 Neighbor Advertisement packets can also be allowed or prohibited
- Installation and update documentation has been improved
- easywall is now programmed completely typed thanks to mypy
- Ports can now be forwarded from the local system. Note that both the source and destination ports must be opened. This is because this is only a nat forwarding and not a FORWARDING forwarding
- The translations have been significantly improved thanks to deepl.com
- Username and password for the web interface can be changed directly in the web interface
- It is recognized if configuration entries are missing. This is especially important in this version, because we have added some variables. You will be notified about the differences in the web interface
- The start page of the web interface has been completely reworked. In the future I imagine a tag cloud from the open ports
- The options page in the web interface now contains almost all settings from the files

### Changed

- Python 3.5 is no longer supported, because no typing of variables is possible
- The detection from the first start has now been changed to a detection at every start. This has proven to be useful, as more rule types may be added in the future.
- The configuration files are reloaded each time a variable is called. This is needed to activate changes from the web interface immediately.
- An additional Python package "natsort" is required. The package offers the possibility to sort the ports naturally.
- The allowed ICMPv4/v6 types are now strongly restricted.

Allowed ICMPv4 types:

- 0 echo-reply
- 3 destination-unreachable
- 11 time-exceeded
- 12 parameter problem

Allowed ICMPv6 types:

- 1 destination-unreachable
- 2 packet-too-big
- 3 time-exceeded
- 4 parameter problem
- 128 echo request
- 129 echo-reply

After explicit configuration the following ICMPv6 types are allowed additionally:

- 133 router solicitation
