Today **Firewalls** are more important than years before. Hackers and Bots are trying to invade your server. So what to do against it?
Set up a firewall! But which one? **IPTables** is the strongest firewall in **Linux** environments. So we wanted to make IPTables usable by everyone. We created a simple **Web Interface** for IPTables so everyone can install and use it on his / her server.

## Demo

> We are currently setting up a self resetting demo server.*
