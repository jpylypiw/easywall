**Firewalls** are becoming increasingly important in today's world. Hackers and automated scripts are constantly trying to **invade your system** and use it for Bitcoin mining, botnets or other things.

To prevent these attacks, you can use a firewall on your system. **IPTables** is the strongest firewall in Linux because it can **filter packets in the kernel** before they reach the application. Using IPTables is **not very easy** for Linux beginners. We have created easywall - the simple **IPTables web interface**. The focus of the software is on easy installation and use.

## Demo

You can view an online version of the program as a demo under the following link:

<https://dev01vt.wdkro.de:12227/> (Certificate is provided by Let's Encrypt)

- **Username**: demo
- **Password**: demo

The online demo version is reset every 30 minutes and all data is deleted. The demo has only the frontend installed without the backend. Configuration changes are therefore not saved or applied.

## Quick Start

This guide refers to the easiest way to install using the APT Package Manager. For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/jpylypiw/easywall/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md).

## Support me

The project easywall was created in a time when I did not have any knowledge about Linux. Today I work as an administrator for Linux systems and would not need this project anymore. Nevertheless it is important to me to support the introduction to Linux and the use and simplification of firewalls.

To continue the project, I need your support! Please donate so that I can continue the project in my spare time. Every dollar counts! You can find a donation link on [GitHub](https://github.com/jpylypiw/easywall).
